Version 1.10.0 (interim release):
---------------------------------

- Ported from 1.4 branch to trunk. Cycholka/Mist ran wmllint on it for
  making it compatible with Wesnoth 1.5.1 and later.
- Prevented past-the-end WML array access using new macros,
  VARIABLE_RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT and RANDOM_SUBSCRIPT.
  All WML found with the regular expression /\.\.\$[a-zA-Z0-9_]*\.length/
  was fixed to use this method.
- Removed many unused macros.
    - Ditch IS_ON_MAP in favor of mainline NOT_ON_RECALL_LIST.
- Switched back from ~ preprocessor includes to @, which allows IftU to be
  loaded from a mainline datadir if present. This is completely absurd IMO, but
  users of our SVN trunk have the weird habit of making the checkout in such
  exotic locations...

- Graphics:
    - Added baseframes: Elvish Civilian (bow attack), Elvish Avatar,
                        Elvish Ascetic

    - Updated portraits: Dryad [P]

- Language and i18n:
    - Changed unit race text for female Demons from "race+female^Demon"
      to "race+female^Demoness".
    - Changed female unit_type names for the Demon tree to be of the
      "Demoness" form rather than "Demon".

      being moved to a public location reachable by this campaign.

- Scenarios:
    - Added first-time description for Elynia, Erathan and Althurin.
    - Character first-time descriptions and the option to skip them are enabled
      when starting straight from episode II.

      suggested by Espreon.
    - Player can choose Galas initial unit type when starting straight from
      episode II.

      engine bugs on arithmetic with WML variables containing real numbers)
    - Sanitized many event unit filters.
    - Some dialogs were improved (Shadow Master alone, with nobody's help!
                                  mwahahahahahhaaa!!!)
    - Turned Anlindë from Elvish Sorceress into Elvish Ascetic.
    - 1 (Border Patrol):
        - Map balancing.

        - A few dialogue improvements at the start - they also involve changes
          on the free recall mechanics.
        - Add an explanation for the Elvish civilians.
        - Other balancing changes.
