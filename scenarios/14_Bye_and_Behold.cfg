As we have just managed to escape from a major assault, I can tell you of the great darkness that approaches. You will not survive long with this defensive attitude - eventually the enemy will destroy your natural resources, take over your country, and exterminate the survivors. You ought to admit it: the only chance we have to avoid obliteration is to obliterate the Chaos Empire. And since they do not expect any major opposition to remain, time is of the essence.")}
