    # This is somewhat of a tiny stub scenario using configuration carried
    # over from E1S10x using WML variables. The intention is to allow players
    # to replay the cutscene skipping to the historical part if they want. All
    # unit and map configuration is done dynamically. I suppose it might also
    # be of interest to aspiring advanced WML coders.
    #
    # The variables required from E1S10x are:
    #
    #   e1s10x_state
    #       Actual game, units, and gamemap state data.
    #   elynia_loc
    #       Used to avoid hardcoding Elynia's intended initial location
    #       everywhere.
    #   side1_params
    #       Partial side 1 gameplay state from E1S10x prestart including its
    #       recruit list and gold reserve, both of which are cleared for the
    #       duration of both E1S10x and E1S10y.
