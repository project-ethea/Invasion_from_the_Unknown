The place was abundantly illuminated through openings in the tall ceiling, rendering their torches and magic pointless. The whole chamber appeared to have been built not by an ancient civilization, but by the earth itself. Standing out amidst the chamber was a lush courtyard enclosed by five trees in a geometric arrangement, with a sixth tree in the middle of all.

An eerie gust of wind from the deep abyss below extinguished the fires as though intent on protecting the secret sanctuary from harm."
