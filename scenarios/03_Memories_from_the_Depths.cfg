Something or someone apparently opened a portal—a new one—to the very heart of Inferno, unleashing the forces of evil and allowing them to cross the barrier dividing our realm from theirs. This may have been done from our world, or it may not. Arrogant unscrupulous magi cast us into this chaotic future before when they raised the two unnatural suns. But yes... the humans are building a new empire of blood and destruction, and from what I gather you are the victims of its northwards expansion."
