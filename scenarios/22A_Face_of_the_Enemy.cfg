        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "Our extensive research allowed us to select the best characteristics of all natural lifeforms in our domain and combine them into a new creature. Thus the ‘invincibles’, or ‘Shaxthals’, were born. Our original intention was to use this knowledge to advance our civilization beyond the limits of mortality, and achieve the dream of eternal life. However, a hostile invasion from Rythé brought our plan to an abrupt halt.")}

        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "After years of war, desperate for a resolution we saw fit to employ our invincibles as weapons against our ancient enemy, and much to our amazement, the plan worked. But even though we managed to fend off Rythé’s forces for a while, in doing so we garnered new attention from a mysterious entity whose existence we had ignored thus far.")}

        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "A powerful beam of pure darkness struck our world, destroying our civilization, and our creations. Our population swiftly dwindled, and the Rythenians took advantage of the situation. Cornered and without escape from the increasingly poisonous air, we devised a mechanism that allowed us to escape into a world beyond the veil; a primitive world devoid of intelligent life, a world stranded in a limbo between times.")}

        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "Although our new home was far too hostile for us to survive on the surface, we found shelter under the ground, where we decided we would try to rebuild our civilization. However...")}

        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "Originally non-sentient, the Shaxthals we brought with us somehow developed minds of their own, with new instincts and desires, and they could no longer be restrained by their creators. They began to attack and assimilate the remnants of our people and spawn new generations with new, more sophisticated bodies able to protect them against our weapons. Their numbers increased at an exceedingly fast rate, and we could not do anything to save ourselves in time.")}

        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "With barely a few dozen of us left, we figured out a way to thwart the Shaxthals’ reproductive capabilities. And thus the circle was completed: our hope for eternal life became the instrument of our demise, forcing us to conceive a formula to destroy it at the dusk of our time.")}

        {MSG_GLYPH ( _ "In spite of our protests, the elders ordered us to take a few of the last Shaxthal creatures and put them into preservation pods for further experimentation, believing that they might still hold the key to our survival. By then it was too late, and we no longer had specialists able to do any new research. We could only make sure to record our history and thoughts into these crystal glyphs, with the hope that perhaps some day someone will resurrect our fallen race.")}
