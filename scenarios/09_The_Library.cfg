        {__MSG_GLYPH ( _ "To stop the conflict of Light and Darkness, a third power was created, the Neutroume. It would separate Light and Darkness, and allow their coexistence. However, the perfect balance brought by the Neutroume was brief, as the Neutroume corrupted itself. This spawned the beings known as 'daelums', 'daemons' or 'demons'.")}

        {__MSG_GLYPH ( _ "The Union was allowed to exist for enough time to defeat the Neutroume and bind it to its own plane of existence, to its own prison, with the demons. After that, for safety, the Union entity was dismantled and separated into three abstract objects, the Body of the Union, the Globe of Light and the Globe of Darkness.")}

But this was made almost impossible by sending each globe to distant, different places in the Cosmos. Yet, the original Body of the Union was left, hidden in Irya, fourth planet of the Ardaan system.")}

        {__MSG_GLYPH ( _ "Merging the arcane flows piped through their powers would allow the power of the Union to be valid every time, requiring the former action to be taken in each oportunity.")}
        {__MSG_GLYPH ( _ "The death of any of those two beings, bound and linked by the Unbreakable, will invalidate the Union and dismantle the power once again. Their original bodies will be left, without the powers of Light or Darkness that were granted to them originally. The Globes will be spawned again, and the cycle will repeat.")}
