The Empire’s lands are very poorly guarded right now, and even though the enemy’s prepared to defend the capital against potential attacks, their numbers are not too impressive. If we act fast, they will not have the time to call for reinforcements from the border outposts. On the other hand, we’ve heard dark rumors..."
