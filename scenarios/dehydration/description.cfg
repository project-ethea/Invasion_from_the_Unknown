        message= _ "During the daytime (Dawn, Morning, Mid-day, Afternoon, and Dusk) at the beginning of each your turns, every unit in sand, road, dune, hills or mountains hexes will suffer from thirst. Each turn of thirst reduces a unit’s attack damage and causes $dehydration_loss hitpoints of damage. Only by being cared for by a healer or refreshing at villages or non-swamp water hexes at the start of your turn will your units regain full attack strength."
