    unit_description= _ "The steppe chieftains are titled Khans, serving as both statesmen and generals. They have discovered the advantages of leading from behind, urging their fellows on before them. Before a battle it is customary for them to mingle with the soldiers, goading them on with threats, promises, insults or just primal bellows. Anything to spur them into a towering rage. Nearly everyone who has fought the orcs of the steppe has spoke of the unnerving roars of the orcish leaders.

Despite this, Khans are more then ready to enter the fray against any especially audacious enemy that seeks to challenge them. Often, while retaining their flail, they focus on using the axe as they are considered too valuable an asset to risk in daredevil charges."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+_" When used on the offensive the intimidation of a Khans charging flail attack decreases the damage he takes in retaliation. This only effects enemies of equal or lesser level."
