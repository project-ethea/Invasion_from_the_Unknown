    description= _ "Some dwarves have crafted strange vehicles which they call ‘Gyrocopters’. Capable of flight, they need space to maneuver, thus they cannot be used underground. These machines are hard to control and are not suited for close combat; instead, their drivers throw strange eggs they call ‘bombs’, that explode with the sound of thunder. Noone knows what strange beast lays such eggs."
