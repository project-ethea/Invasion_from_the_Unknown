    description= _ "Exceedingly few communities have continued to breed domesticated dogs after the Fall; not only because of the harsher climate and scarce resources with which to feed captive animals, but also due to an overabundance of larger and more dangerous predators. The Chaos Empire, on the other hand, not content with using slaves and barbarian mercenaries in warfare, has turned dog breeding into more than a mere pastime. For their quadrupedal companions anything unfamiliar constitutes prey, and they never yield in a fight until they have reduced their target to bloody bits."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}
