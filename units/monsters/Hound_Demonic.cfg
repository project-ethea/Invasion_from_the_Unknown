    description= _ "Their relatively frail builds and propensity to fight amongst themselves means few Chaos Hounds survive a year in service. Those who do, however, promptly earn the Chaos Magiâ€™s attentions. The creatures who survive the reprehensible experiments that follow emerge even sturdier and deadlier killing machines.

It is rumored some Chaos Overlords delight in keeping these hellish hounds as pets. If so, this an even greater deterrant to anyone who would dare enter an Overlord's stronghold uninvited."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BERSERK}
