# HACK: Workaround a strange "recursion prevention" error from the preprocessor
# introduced during the 1.4 beta stage
# i.e. The preprocessor no longer allows recursive macro calls, even with different parameters,
#      the particular culprit being INCLUDE_LOCAL; we must use a different macro name at this
#      recursion level.
### UPDATE 2008-03-04: it seems to have been a bug in the preprocessor, but I decided to continue
### using this new convention nevertheless
#define LDR_PREPROCESS X
{~{LDR_PATH}/{X}}#enddef

# wmlindent: stop ignoring

# NOTE: do not change the order in which these files are preprocessing unless
# you are very sure of what you are doing.
