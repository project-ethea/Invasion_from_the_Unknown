    * Added wall moss overlays from Naia/AtS to hive maps.
    * Unit loyalty in boss/finale scenarios is now controlled using temporary
      or permanent [object] modifications instead of direct attribute

      Anlindë, and Elynia (issue #27).

    * Minor music and UI tweaks.

* Units:

      2 instead of 1 (fully upgraded total is now 11-3).

    synced between IftU 2.0.1 and AtS 0.9.17+.

    * Possessed units regenerate less health.
    * Reduced frequency of Psy Crawler spawns.
    * The boss can only spawn Shaxthal Worms when hit during the last stage on

    * The boss can no longer remove negative effects (which is to say, the
      slowed effect) while absorbing damage during the second stage of the
      boss fight. The justification is that this boss does not have the same

    * Cold 70% -> 50%
  * Fixed a cutscene unit type used for Anlindë being always visible in the

    to become loyal for the remainder of the campaign due to an engine bug in
    the implementation of [object] duration=scenario with certain effects. This
    causes auto-recalls to cost upkeep again in scenarios 2, 3, 4, 5a, 5b, 6,
    8, and 10.

    * Cleaner (but functionally-equivalent) fix for the SLF issue fixed
